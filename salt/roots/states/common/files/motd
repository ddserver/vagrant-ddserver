Welcome to your ddserver test system.

This virtual machine is configured with all the tools needed to run ddserver.

MySQL has been configured with no root password. The database for ddserver is
called "ddserver" and can be acceddes by the ddserver user "ddserver", who has
its password set to "YourDatabasePassword".

PowerDNS has been configured with the simplebind backend to provide the zone
example.org with common resource records (SOA and NS). To allow ddserver to
communicate with PowerDNS, {{ pdns_backend }} has been installed.

The ddserver repository has been checked out to /usr/local/src/ddserver.

You can login to the ddserver WebUI from your host system by navigating to
http://127.0.0.1:8080 using your preferred web browser. The username and
password of the administrator is "admin". In the WebUI, create a zone called
"example.org" and add some hostnames (i.e., test) to the zone. Using a command
like dig, you can then query your hostnames as follows:

  dig test.example.org @127.0.0.1 [-p 5353]

If you have any questions, please refer to the documentation at
https://docs.ddserver.org

Have fun.
