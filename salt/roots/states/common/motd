Welcome to your ddserver test system.

This virtual machine is configured with all the tools needed to run ddserver.

MySQL has been configured with no root password. The database for ddserver is
called "ddserver" and can be acceddes by the ddserver user "ddserver", who has
its password set to "YourDatabasePassword".

PowerDNS has been configured with the simplebind backend to provide the zone
example.org with common resource records (SOA and NS). To allow ddserver to
communicate with PowerDNS, {{ pdns_backend }} has been installed.

The ddserver repository has been checked out to /usr/local/src/ddserver.

You can login to the ddserver web-ui by navigating to 127.0.0.1:8080 with 
username admin and password admin. In the web-ui, create a zone example.org and 
some hostnames (i.e., test) in this zone. Using a command like dig, you can then
query your hostnames as follows:

  dig test.example.org @127.0.0.1 [-p 5353]

If you have any questions, please refer to the documentation at https://ddserver.org

Have fun.
